#STABILIZER BELT
ttresearch.name.STABILIZER_BELT=Stabilizer Belt
ttresearch.lore.STABILIZER_BELT=Knockback? but I like it here
ttresearch.page.STABILIZER_BELT.0=Using similar technology to that found in the thaumostatic harness, you've created a special belt that nullifies the effect of knockback.<BR><BR>Any time you take damage, instead of being knocked around, you will instead remain in place. You have found this device to be extremely useful for not only flying using the harness, but also and travel at night.

#ENDER_DISRUPTER
ttresearch.name.ENDER_DISRUPTER=Ender Disruptor
ttresearch.lore.ENDER_DISRUPTER=Stop jumping around like that and fight me!
ttresearch.page.ENDER_DISRUPTER.0=After careful research into ender pearls, you have discovered how the Endermen's teleportation works, and more importantly how to stop it.<BR><BR>If you infuse an ender pearl with taint, the taint affects the border between this world and the dimension Endermen use to travel from one place to the other, closing it. You theorize if you make this into an amulet, they will not be able to teleport around you while you wear it.<BR><BR>The stress of holding taint and spreading it through the dimensional border does wear on the amulet, and it will eventually fall apart.

#COMET_BOOTS
ttresearch.name.COMET_BOOTS=Boots of the Comet
ttresearch.lore.COMET_BOOTS=Ice ice baby
ttresearch.page.COMET_BOOTS.0=The Boots of the Traveller are fast, but you think that there is room for improvement. By infusing the Boots of the Traveller with Aqua and Gelum, you have created a pair of boots with unrivaled speed.<BR><BR>These boots allow the user to run with the speed of a comet, covering large tracts of land in a matter of seconds. Water can do nothing to slow you. When wearing the Boots of the Comet, water will be temporarily frozen under your feet.

#FOOD_TALISMAN
ttresearch.name.FOOD_TALISMAN=Talisman of Nourishment
ttresearch.lore.FOOD_TALISMAN=Everfull belly
ttresearch.page.FOOD_TALISMAN.0=You often find yourself needing to take breaks during marathon researching sessions to satisfy your hunger. Finally you have found a way to get past your need for food.<BR><BR>By infusing a diamond with the essence of hunger, you have created an item that is able to suck the nourishing energy from various food items in your hotbar and store this energy within. It will then automatically replenish your food meter if it is depleted.<BR><BR>This device will only work on simple food items, so foods that invoke effects such as Rotten Flesh and Golden Apples must be consumed normally.

#BLOOD_SWORD
ttresearch.name.BLOOD_SWORD=Cursed Spirit's Blade
ttresearch.lore.BLOOD_SWORD=You're being unpleasent.
ttresearch.page.BLOOD_SWORD.0=You created a sword that strikes with unparalleled force. However, for this to be the case, the sword feeds on the striker's blood.<BR><BR>Upon damaging anything with this sword, the attacker will take one heart of damage. Blocking with this sword will always deal only 1.5 hearts, regardless of the original damage.<BR><BR>Furthermore, simply holding this sword gives the holder a steadfast aura, making them move faster than normal.

# METEOR_BOOTS
--Boots of the Meteor
ttresearch.name.METEOR_BOOTS=Boots of the Meteor
ttresearch.lore.METEOR_BOOTS=Come on and slam
ttresearch.page.METEOR_BOOTS.0=Your Boots of the Traveller have been very useful, but sometimes you have desired even more mobility. By imbuing the Boots of the Traveller with the raw power of Ignis and Potentia, you have created a pair of boots with unrivaled mobility.<BR><BR>These boots propel the wearer with the force of a meteor in the direction they are looking, if they jump while crouching. Pressing the crouch button when in midair will launch the player towards the ground at incredible speeds, damaging anything near the point of impact.

# CLEANSING_TALISMAN
ttresearch.name.CLEANSING_TALISMAN=Talisman of Remedium
ttresearch.lore.CLEANSING_TALISMAN=Mitsukake's Gift
ttresearch.page.CLEANSING_TALISMAN.0=You have studied life and the body and found that through the application of magic you can protect yourself from harmful outside influences by redirecting these effects to a construct. This talisman will dispel most harmful effects on the holder and keep them on itself, taking damage. It will remove some warp effects, at an extreme durability cost.<BR><BR>To enable or disable this ability, one would shift-right click on it. As expected, it only works whilst enabled. It must be worn in your amulet slot to take effect.


# DARK_QUARTZ
ttresearch.name.DARK_QUARTZ=Smokey Quartz
ttresearch.lore.DARK_QUARTZ=Shadow of the Day
ttresearch.page.DARK_QUARTZ.0=Smokey Quartz is pretty much Quartz, but negative. All regular blocks that can be made with quartz, can also be made with smokey quartz, and they look black.<BR><BR>Smokey Quartz itself can be made with a piece of coal or charcoal for tinting, and a few pieces of regular nether quartz.


# JAR_SEAL
ttresearch.name.JAR_SEAL=Seal of Jar Binding
ttresearch.lore.JAR_SEAL=Essentia, essentia everywhere
ttresearch.page.JAR_SEAL.0=By adjusting the mixture of aspects that you soak the tallow seal in to account for essentia's mystical properties, you have found that you are able to bind essentia containers, in particular, warded jars. Much like your previous binding seals, the jar binding seal can be dyed and an unlimited amount of networks can be created.<BR><BR>By right clicking on a jar with a jar binding seal, you can create a new network. Right clicking on a bound jar will link the seal to that network.
ttresearch.page.JAR_SEAL.1=Right clicking on an unbound jar with a linked seal will add that jar to the linked network. Note that only empty jars are able to be bound. You can not bind void jars or jars with labels.<BR><BR>Sealed jars have a higher suction than unlabeled jars but lower than labeled jars.
ttresearch.page.JAR_SEAL.2=You may use a dye to dye a seal to any desired colour. You may also name it in an anvil to gain any desired network name

# MOB_SUMMON
ttresearch.name.MOB_SUMMON=Mob Summoning
ttresearch.lore.MOB_SUMMON=Almost Necromancy
ttresearch.page.MOB_SUMMON.0=You are able to use the souls gained from a Cursed spirits blade in order to summon mobs. Place three pedestals around a Tablet of Necromancy. On the pedestals, place three soul aspects. Different types of soul aspects give different types of mobs. Every mob has a different composition.
ttresearch.page.MOB_SUMMON.1=By creating Infused Soul Aspects, you are able to summon mobs without consuming Soul Aspects. Summoning using Infused Soul Aspects is much slower than normal.
